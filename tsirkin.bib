abstract={Wannier interpolation is a powerful tool for performing Brillouin zone integrals over dense grids of k points, which are essential to evaluate such quantities as the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity or Boltzmann transport coefficients. However, more complex physical problems and materials create harder numerical challenges, and computations with the existing codes become very expensive, which often prevents reaching the desired accuracy. In this article, I present a series of methods that boost the speed of Wannier interpolation by several orders of magnitude. They include a combination of fast and slow Fourier transforms, explicit use of symmetries, and recursive adaptive grid refinement among others. The proposed methodology has been implemented in the python code WannierBerri, which also aims to serve as a convenient platform for the future development of interpolation schemes for other phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic topological phases of quantum matter are an emerging frontier in physics and material science. Along these lines, several kagome magnets have appeared as the most promising platforms. Here, we explore magnetic correlations in the kagome magnet Co3Sn2S2. Using muon spin-rotation, we present evidence for competing magnetic orders in the kagome lattice of this compound. Our results show that while the sample exhibits an out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground state, an in-plane antiferromagnetic state appears at temperatures above 90 K, eventually attaining a volume fraction of 80{\%} around 170 K, before reaching a non-magnetic state. Strikingly, the reduction of the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) above 90 K linearly follows the disappearance of the volume fraction of the ferromagnetic state. We further show that the competition of these magnetic phases is tunable through applying either an external magnetic field or hydrostatic pressure. Our results taken together suggest the thermal and quantum tuning of Berry curvature induced AHC via external tuning of magnetic order.},

@article{flatband,
    Abstract = {Electronic systems with flat bands are predicted to be a fertile ground for hosting emergent phenomena including unconventional magnetism and superconductivity1--15, but materials that manifest this feature are rare. Here, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to elucidate the atomically resolved electronic states and their magnetic response in the kagome magnet Co3Sn2S2 (refs. 16--20). We observe a pronounced peak at the Fermi level, which we identify as arising from the kinetically frustrated kagome flat band. On increasing the magnetic field up to $\pm$8 T, this state exhibits an anomalous magnetization-polarized many-body Zeeman shift, dominated by an orbital moment that is opposite to the field direction. Such negative magnetism is induced by spin--orbit-coupling quantum phase effects21--25 tied to non-trivial flat band systems. We image the flat band peak, resolve the associated negative magnetism and provide its connection to the Berry curvature field, showing that Co3Sn2S2 is a rare example of a kagome magnet where the low-energy physics can be dominated by the spin--orbit-coupled flat band.},

@article{nodeless,
    Abstract = {Recently, the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) system 2M-WS2 has been identified as a Dirac semimetal exhibiting both superconductivity with the highest Tc \~{} 8.5 K among all the TMD materials and topological surface states. Here we report on muon spin rotation (μSR) and density functional theory studies of microscopic SC properties and the electronic structure in 2M-WS2 at ambient and under hydrostatic pressures (pmax = 1.9 GPa). The SC order parameter in 2M-WS2 is determined to have single-gap s-wave symmetry. We further show a strong negative pressure effect on Tc and on the SC gap Δ. This may be partly caused by the pressure induced reduction of the size of the electron pocket around the Γ-point. We also find that the superfluid density ns is weakly affected by pressure. The absence of a strong pressure effect on ns and the absence of a correlation between ns and Tc in 2M-WS2, in contrast to the other SC TMDs Td-MoTe2 and 2H-NbSe2, is explained in terms of its location in the optimal (ambient pressure) and above the optimal (under pressure) superconducting regions of the phase diagram and its large distance to the other possible competing or cooperating orders.},

abstract={Magnetic topological phases of quantum matter are an emerging frontier in physics and material science. Along these lines, several kagome magnets have appeared as the most promising platforms. Here, we explore magnetic correlations in the kagome magnet Co3Sn2S2. Using muon spin-rotation, we present evidence for competing magnetic orders in the kagome lattice of this compound. Our results show that while the sample exhibits an out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground state, an in-plane antiferromagnetic state appears at temperatures above 90 K, eventually attaining a volume fraction of 80\% around 170 K, before reaching a non-magnetic state. Strikingly, the reduction of the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) above 90 K linearly follows the disappearance of the volume fraction of the ferromagnetic state. We further show that the competition of these magnetic phases is tunable through applying either an external magnetic field or hydrostatic pressure. Our results taken together suggest the thermal and quantum tuning of Berry curvature induced AHC via external tuning of magnetic order.},

Journal = {{Phys. Rev. B}},

Abstract = {{We classify the band degeneracies in three-dimensional crystals with
   screw symmetry n(m) and broken P{*}T symmetry, where P stands for
   spatial inversion and T for time reversal. The generic degeneracies
   along symmetry lines are Weyl nodes: chiral contact points between pairs
   of bands. They can be single nodes with a chiral charge of magnitude
   |chi| = 1 or composite nodes with |chi| = 2 or 3, and the possible chi
   values only depend on the order n of the axis, not on the pitch m/n of
   the screw. Double Weyl nodes require n = 4 or 6, and triple nodes
   require n = 6. In all cases, the bands split linearly along the axis,
   and for composite nodes the splitting is quadratic on the orthogonal
   plane. This is true for triple as well as double nodes, due to the
   presence in the effective two-band Hamiltonian of a nonchiral quadratic
   term that masks the chiral cubic dispersion. If T symmetry is present
   and P is broken, there may exist on some symmetry lines Weyl nodes
   pinned to T-invariant momenta, which in some cases are unavoidable. In
   the absence of other symmetries, their classification depends on n, m,
   and the type of T symmetry. With spinless T such T-invariant Weyl nodes
   are always double nodes, while with spinful T they can be single or
   triple nodes. T-invariant triples nodes can occur not only on sixfold
   axes but also on threefold ones, and their in-plane band splitting is
   cubic, not quadratic as in the case of generic triple nodes. These rules
   are illustrated by means of first-principles calculations for hcp
   cobalt, a T-broken, P-invariant crystal with 63 symmetry, and for
   trigonal tellurium and hexagonal NbSi2, which are T-invariant, P-broken
   crystals with threefold and sixfold screw symmetry, respectively.}},

   resulting lifetimes. The presence of the unoccupied molecular states
   below the IS gives a small contribution to the IS decay rate, which is
   mostly determined by the change of the phase space of bulk states upon
   the energy shift of the IS. The calculated lifetimes follow the

   the unusual increase of the IS lifetimes with rising temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The modification of the graphene spin structure is of interest for novel
   possibilities of application of graphene in spintronics. The most
   exciting of them demand not only high value of spin-orbit splitting of
   the graphene states, but non-Rashba behavior of the splitting and
   spatial modulation of the spin-orbit interaction. In this work we study
   the spin and electronic structure of graphene on Ir(111) with
   intercalated Pt monolayer. Pt interlayer does not change the 9.3 x 9.3
   superlattice of graphene, while the spin structure of the Dirac cone
   becomes modified. It is shown that the Rashba splitting of the pi state
   is reduced, while hybridization of the graphene and substrate states
   leads to a spin-dependent avoided-crossing effect near the Fermi level.
   Such a variation of spin-orbit interaction combined with the
   superlattice effects can induce a topological phase in graphene.}},

Journal = {{Scientific Reports}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Intriguing phenomena and novel physics predicted for two-dimensional
   (2D) systems formed by electrons in Dirac or Rashba states motivate an
   active search for new materials or combinations of the already revealed
   ones. Being very promising ingredients in themselves, interplaying Dirac
   and Rashba systems can provide a base for next generation of spintronics
   devices, to a considerable extent, by mixing their striking properties
   or by improving technically significant characteristics of each other.
   Here, we demonstrate that in BiTeI@PbSb2Te4 composed of a BiTeI trilayer
   on top of the topological insulator (TI) PbSb2Te4 weakly- and
   strongly-coupled Dirac-Rashba hybrid systems are realized. The coupling
   strength depends on both interface hexagonal stacking and
   trilayer-stacking order. The weakly-coupled system can serve as a
   prototype to examine, e.g., plasmonic excitations, frictional drag,
   spin-polarized transport, and charge-spin separation effect in
   multilayer helical metals. In the strongly-coupled regime, within
   similar to 100 meV energy interval of the bulk TI projected bandgap a
   helical state substituting for the TI surface state appears. This new
   state is characterized by a larger momentum, similar velocity, and
   strong localization within BiTeI. We anticipate that our findings pave
   the way for designing a new type of spintronics devices based on
   Rashba-Dirac coupled systems.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic and spin structure of a graphene monolayer synthesized on

   photoemission with different polarizations of incident synchrotron
   radiation and using density functional theory calculations. It is shown
   that despite the observed total quasifreestanding character of the
   dispersion of the graphene pi state remarkable local distortions and
   breaks in the dispersions take place due to hybridization between the
   graphene pi and Pt d states. Corresponding spin-dependent
   avoided-crossing effects lead to significant modification of the spin
   structure and cause an enhanced induced spin-orbit splitting of the
   graphene pi states near the Fermi level in the region of the (K)over-bar
   point of the graphene Brillouin zone (BZ) with a magnitude of 80-200 meV
   depending on the direction in the BZ. Using p, s, and elliptical
   polarizations of the synchrotron radiation, the contributions of the
   graphene pi and Pt d states were separated and their intersection at the
   Fermi level, which is important for effective spin injection between
   these states, was shown. Moreover, analysis of the data allows us to
   conclude that in the region of the Dirac point the spin structure of the

   energy-band dispersion exhibits a kink structure at similar to-20 meV,
   which is a clear indication of band renormalization caused by an
   electron-phonon interaction. The electron-phonon coupling parameter is
   found to be lambda(ep) = 0.17 +/- 0.02 based on the experimentally
   obtained real part of the self-energy. First-principle calculations
   yield lambda(ep) = 0.160 and Delta k(F) = 0.004 angstrom(-1) at E-F,
   which are fully consistent with the experimental results. In addition,
   the contributions of the electron-electron and electron-phonon
   interactions to the linewidth of the surface state at the Y point are
   experimentally determined to be Gamma(ee) similar to 9 meV and Gamma(ep)

Abstract = {{The ability to engineer an electronic band structure of topological
   insulators would allow the production of topological materials with
   tailor-made properties. Using ab initio calculations, we show a
   promising way to control the conducting surface state in topological
   insulator based heterostructures representing an insulator ultrathin
   films on the topological insulator substrates. Because of a specific
   relation between work functions and band gaps of the topological
   insulator substrate and the insulator ultrathin film overlayer, a
   sizable shift of the Dirac point occurs resulting in a significant
   increase in the number of the topological surface state charge carriers
   as compared to that of the substrate itself. Such an effect can also be
   realized by applying the external electric field that allows a gradual
   tuning of the topological surface state. A simultaneous use of both
   approaches makes it possible to obtain a topological insulator based
   heterostructure with a highly tunable topological surface state.}},

   electronic properties of the topological insulator Bi2Te3 in the energy
   range between -200 and +700 meV with respect to the Fermi level. For
   unoccupied states, tunneling into topological surface states dominates.
   Analysis of Fourier-transformed (FT) dI/dU maps allowed us to obtain
   their energy dispersion relation and to visualize the breakdown of the
   linear dispersion relation typical of massless particles. For occupied
   states, no signature of scattering events involving surface states can
   be detected. FT dI/dU maps reveal in this case two scattering vectors
   pointing along the (Gamma M) over bar and (Gamma K) over bar directions.
   Both are identified with scattering events within bulk states.
   Interestingly, vectors pointing along (Gamma K) over bar which
   correspond to bulk backscattering events have a length longer than the
   minimum distance necessary to match opposite pockets on a constant
   energy cut. Comparison with calculated spin-resolved constant-energy
   cuts shows that this is a direct consequence of the chiral spin texture
   present in bulk states when their energy and momentum are close to the
   resonances of the spin-polarized topological surface states.}},

Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{We present a theoretical study of the image potential resonances (IPRs)
   at metal surfaces. We develop the Green's functions approach allowing us
   to calculate binding energies E-n and lifetimes tau(n) of IPRs with high
   quantum numbers n (up to 10 in this work). A systematic study is
   performed at the (Gamma) over bar point for the close-packed metal
   surfaces: Cu(111), Ag(111), Au(111), Al(001), Al(111), Be(0001),
   Mg(0001), Na(110), Li(110), and also at the (Y) over bar point on
   Cu(110). The calculated lifetimes of IPRs on close-packed surfaces
   demonstrate the scaling law tau(n) proportional to n(3). Our results are
   in agreement with available experimental data. We show that at the (Y)
   over bar point on Cu(110) each quantum number n corresponds to a pair of
   IPRs n(+) and n(-), where the energy difference En+ - En- is
   proportional to n(-3). The lifetimes tau(n+) and tau(n-) differ
   significantly, however, they both obey the scaling law tau(n +/-)
   proportional to n(3). Since the electrons trapped in the long-lived IPRs
   are strongly localized on the vacuum side, we argue that the inelastic
   electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering have a small
   contribution to the decay rate of these IPRs. The latter is dominated by
   the resonant electron transfer into the bulk.}},

Abstract = {{The dependence of the inelastic lifetime of electrons in the first n = 1
   image-potential state of clean and rare-gas covered Ag(111), Cu(111),
   and Cu(100) surfaces on their momentum parallel to the surface has been
   studied experimentally by means of time-and angle-resolved two-photon
   photoemission spectroscopy (2PPE) and theoretically by calculations
   based on the many-body theory within the self-energy formalism. Similar
   to the previously studied clean Cu(100) surface, the theoretical results
   are in excellent agreement with the experiment findings for Cu(111). For
   Ag(111), the theory overestimates the decay rate and its momentum
   dependence, which is attributed to the neglect of surface plasmon
   excitations. With increasing parallel momentum, the n = 1 state shifts
   out of the projected bulk band gap on both surfaces and turns into an
   image-potential resonance. This opens an additional decay channel by
   resonant electron transfer into the bulk, which is theoretically treated
   by the application of the wave packet propagation approach. The expected
   stronger increase of the decay rate upon crossing the edge of the band
   gap, however, is not observed in the experiment. The decoupling of the
   image-potential states from the metal surface upon adsorption of
   rare-gas layers results in a decrease of the decay rate as well as of

   explained by the change of interband and intraband contributions to the

Abstract = {{The dependence of the intrinsic line width I{''} of electron and hole

Abstract = {{A detailed theoretical study of electron-phonon interaction in occupied
   and unoccupied (Y) over bar surface states on Cu(110), Ag(110), and
   Pd(110) is carried out. We show that in the unoccupied surface state on
   Cu(110) and Ag(110) the e-ph coupling parameter lambda is about three
   times smaller than that in the occupied surface state due to distinct
   phonon modes that contribute to e-ph scattering. The difference in
   mechanisms of phonon-mediated scattering for excited holes and electrons
   results from distinct spatial localization of occupied and unoccupied
   states. In spite of both (Y) over bar surface states on Pd(110) are
   unoccupied they have spatial distribution similar to that on other
   considered noble metal surfaces that leads to different phonon-mediated
   scattering in these states too.}},
