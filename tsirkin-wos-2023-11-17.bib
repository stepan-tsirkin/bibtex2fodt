Abstract = {We present a first-principles theoretical study employing nonlinear
   response theory to investigate the dc photocurrent generated by linearly
   polarized light in the type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. We report the
   low-energy spectrum of several nonlinear optical effects. At second
   order, we consider the shift and injection currents. Assuming the
   presence of a built-in static electric field, at third order we study
   the current-induced shift and injection currents, as well as the jerk
   current. We discuss our results in the context of a recent experiment
   measuring an exceptionally large photoconductivity in this material
   {[}J. Ma et al., Nat. Mater. 18, 476 (2019)]. According to our results,
   the jerk current is the most likely origin of the large response.
   Finally, we propose means to discern the importance of the various
   mechanisms involved in a time-resolved experiment.},

Title = {Topological zero-dimensional defect and flux states in three-dimensional
   insulators},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {In insulating crystals, it was previously shown that defects with two
   fewer dimensions than the bulk can bind topological electronic states.
   We here further extend the classification of topological defect states
   by demonstrating that the corners of crystalline defects with integer
   Burgers vectors can bind 0D higher-order end (HEND) states with
   anomalous charge and spin. We demonstrate that HEND states are intrinsic
   topological consequences of the bulk electronic structure and introduce
   new bulk topological invariants that are predictive of HEND dislocation
   states in solid-state materials. We demonstrate the presence of
   first-order 0D defect states in PbTe monolayers and HEND states in 3D
   SnTe crystals. We relate our analysis to magnetic flux insertion in
   insulating crystals. We find that pi-flux tubes in inversion- and
   time-reversal-symmetric (helical) higher-order topological insulators
   bind Kramers pairs of spin-charge-separated HEND states, which represent
   observable signatures of anomalous surface half quantum spin Hall
   states.},

Journal = {SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {The symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the linear conductivity
   describe the dissipative (Ohmic) and nondissipative (Hall) parts of the
   current. The Hall current is always transverse to the applied electric
   field regardless of its orientation; the Ohmic current is purely
   longitudinal in cubic crystals, but in lower-symmetry crystals it has a
   transverse component whenever the field is not aligned with a principal
   axis. In this work, we extend that analysis beyond the linear regime. We
   consider all possible ways of partitioning the current at any order in
   the electric field without taking symmetry into account, and find that
   the Hall vs Ohmic decomposition is the only one that satisfies certain
   basic requirements. A general prescription is given for achieving that
   decomposition, and the case of the quadratic conductivity is analyzed in
   detail. By performing a symmetry analysis we find that in five of the
   122 magnetic point groups the quadratic dc conductivity is purely Ohmic
   and even under time reversal, a type of response that is entirely
   disorder mediated.},

Title = {Low-temperature magnetic crossover in the topological kagome magnet
   TbMn<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>6</sub>},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Magnetic topological phases of quantum matter are an emerging frontier
   in physics and materials science, of which kagome magnets appear as a
   highly promising platform. Here, we explore magnetic correlations in the
   recently identified topological kagome system TbMn6Sn6 using muon spin
   rotation, combined with local field analysis and neutron diffraction.
   Our studies identify an out-of-plane ferrimagnetic structure with slow
   magnetic fluctuations which exhibit a critical slowing down below
   T-C1{*}similar or equal to 120 K and finally freeze into static patches
   with ideal out-of-plane order below T-C1 similar or equal to 20 K. We
   further show that hydrostatic pressure of 2.1 GPa stabilises the static
   out-of-plane topological ferrimagnetic ground state in the whole volume
   of the sample. Therefore the exciting perspective arises of a
   magnetically-induced topological system whose magnetism can be
   controlled through external parameters. The present results will
   stimulate theoretical investigations to obtain a microscopic
   understanding of the relation between the low-temperature volume-wise
   magnetic evolution of the static c-axis ferrimagnetic patches and the
   topological electronic properties in TbMn6Sn6.},

Title = {Crystal-induced transverse current in collinear antiferromagnetic
   <i>γ</i>-FeMn},
Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {120},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Based on first-principles calculations, we predict a giant
   crystal-induced transverse current in antiferromagnetic gamma-FeMn. This
   abnormal transverse current cannot be understood by the conventional
   anomalous Hall effect (e.g., Berry curvature, skew scattering, and side
   jump), which widely exists in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
   materials. Moreover, the efficiency of the transverse current generation
   therein can be as large as 18.4\% at low temperatures; this is an order
   of magnitude larger than the anomalous Hall angle in conventional
   ferromagnetic materials, such as Fe or Fe-based alloys. Furthermore,
   using the Boltzmann transport equation and a tight-binding model, we
   conclude that the asymmetric group velocities on the Fermi surface are
   the origin of this crystal-induced transverse current in gamma-FeMn.
   Additionally, with a systematic discussion, we show that this unusual
   effect is not dependent on specific materials but is universal in any
   crystal with anisotropic symmetry.},

Abstract = {The manipulation of topological states in quantum matter is an essential
   pursuit of fundamental physics and next-generation quantum technology.
   Here we report the magnetic manipulation of Weyl fermions in the kagome
   spin-orbit semimetal Co3Sn2S2, observed by high-resolution photoemission
   spectroscopy. We demonstrate the exchange collapse of spin-orbit-gapped
   ferromagnetic Weyl loops into paramagnetic Dirac loops under suppression
   of the magnetic order. We further observe that topological Fermi arcs
   disappear in the paramagnetic phase, suggesting the annihilation of
   exchange-split Weyl points. Our findings indicate that magnetic exchange
   collapse naturally drives Weyl fermion annihilation, opening new
   opportunities for engineering topology under correlated order
   parameters.},

Title = {IrRep: Symmetry eigenvalues and irreducible representations of <i>ab

Journal = {COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We presentIrRep- a Python code that calculates the symmetry eigenvalues
   of electronic Bloch states in crystalline solids and the irreducible
   representations under which they transform. As input it receives
   bandstructures computed with state-of-the-art Density Functional Theory
   codes such as VASP, Quantum Espresso, or Abinit, as well as any other
   code that has an interface to Wannier90. Our code is applicable to
   materials in any of the 230 space groups and double groups preserving
   time-reversal symmetry with or without spin-orbit coupling included, for
   primitive or conventional unit cells. This makesIrRepa powerful tool to
   systematically analyze the connectivity and topological classification
   of bands, as well as to detect insulators with non-trivial topology,
   following the Topological Quantum Chemistry formalism: IrRepcan generate
   the input files needed to calculate the (physical) elementary band
   representations and the symmetry-based indicators using the
   CheckTopologicalMatroutine of the Bilbao Crystallographic Server. It is
   also particularly suitable for interfaces with other plane-waves based
   codes, due to its flexible structure.

   Programming language: Python
   Nature of problem: Symmetry properties of electronic band structures in
   solids are tightly related to their topological features. This relation
   is set mathematically by the formalisms of Topological Quantum Chemistry
   {[}1,2] and symmetry-based indicators of topology {[}3], but their
   application requires knowledge of the irreducible representations of the
   bands. Therefore, a code to calculate irreducible representations of ab
   initio bands is essential for a systematic theoretical search and
   classification of topological materials.
   Solution method: IrRepreads wave functions from files generated by VASP,
   Abinit, or Quantum Espresso (also files written as input for Wannier90),
   determines the space group and symmetry operations via thespgliblibrary,
   evaluates the eigenvalues of the symmetry operations for the selected
   bands, and applies Group Theory to determine their irreducible
   representations. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Flat bands with fragile topology through superlattice engineering on
   single-layer graphene},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has received a lot of interest due
   to its flat bands with potentially nontrivial topology that lead to
   intricate correlated phases. A spectrum with flat bands, however, does
   not require a twist between multiple sheets of two-dimensional
   materials, but can be realized with an appropriate periodic potential.
   Here, we propose the imposition of a tailored potential onto a single
   graphene layer through local perturbations that could be created via
   lithography or adatom manipulation, which also results in an energy
   spectrum featuring flat bands. First-principle calculations for an
   appropriate adatom decoration of graphene indeed show the presence of
   flat bands and a symmetry-indicator analysis further reveals the bands'
   topological nature. This nontrivial topology manifests itself in
   corner-localized states with a filling anomaly as we show using a
   tight-binding calculation. Our proposal of a single decorated graphene
   sheet provides a new versatile route to study correlated phases in
   topologically nontrivial, flat band structures.},

Abstract = {The exploration of topological electronic phases that result from strong
   electronic correlations is a frontier in condensed matter physics. One
   class of systems that is currently emerging as a platform for such
   studies are so-called kagome magnets based on transition metals. Using
   muon spin-rotation, we explore magnetic correlations in the kagome
   magnet Co3Sn2-xInxS2 as a function of In-doping, providing putative
   evidence for an intriguing incommensurate helimagnetic (HM) state. Our
   results show that, while the undoped sample exhibits an out-of-plane
   ferromagnetic (FM) ground state, at 5\% of In-doping the system enters a
   state in which FM and in-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases coexist.
   At higher doping, a HM state emerges and becomes dominant at the
   critical doping level of only x(cr,1) similar or equal to 0.3. This
   indicates a zero temperature first order quantum phase transition from
   the FM, through a mixed state, to a helical phase at x(cr,1). In
   addition, at x(cr,2) similar or equal to 1, a zero temperature second
   order phase transition from helical to paramagnetic phase is observed,
   evidencing a HM quantum critical point (QCP) in the phase diagram of the
   topological magnet Co3Sn2-xInxS2. The observed diversity of interactions
   in the magnetic kagome lattice drives non-monotonous variations of the
   topological Hall response of this system.},

Title = {From triple-point materials to multiband nodal links},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {103},
Number = {12},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {We study a class of topological materials which in their momentum-space
   band structure exhibit threefold degeneracies known as triple points.
   Focusing specifically on PT-symmetric crystalline solids with negligible
   spin-orbit coupling, we find that such triple points can be stabilized
   by little groups containing a three-, four-, or sixfold rotation axis,
   and we develop a classification of all possible triple points as type A
   vs type B according to the absence vs presence of attached nodal-line
   arcs. Furthermore, by employing the recently discovered non-Abelian band
   topology, we argue that a rotation-symmetry-breaking strain transforms
   type-A triple points into multiband nodal links. Although multiband
   nodal-line compositions were previously theoretically conceived and
   related to topological monopole charges, a practical condensed-matter
   platform for their manipulation and inspection has hitherto been
   missing. By reviewing the known triple-point materials with weak
   spin-orbit coupling and by performing first-principles calculations to
   predict new ones, we identify suitable candidates for the realization of
   multiband nodal links in applied strain. In particular, we report that
   an ideal compound to study this phenomenon is Li2NaN, in which the
   conversion of triple points to multiband nodal links facilitates a
   largely tunable density of states and optical conductivity with doping
   and strain, respectively.},

Title = {High performance Wannier interpolation of Berry curvature and related
   quantities with WannierBerri code},
Journal = {NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {Wannier interpolation is a powerful tool for performing Brillouin zone
   integrals over dense grids of k points, which are essential to evaluate
   such quantities as the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity or
   Boltzmann transport coefficients. However, more complex physical
   problems and materials create harder numerical challenges, and
   computations with the existing codes become very expensive, which often
   prevents reaching the desired accuracy. In this article, I present a
   series of methods that boost the speed of Wannier interpolation by
   several orders of magnitude. They include a combination of fast and slow
   Fourier transforms, explicit use of symmetries, and recursive adaptive
   grid refinement among others. The proposed methodology has been
   implemented in the python code WannierBerri, which also aims to serve as
   a convenient platform for the future development of interpolation
   schemes for other phenomena.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Number = {7},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {As exemplified by the growing interest in the quantum anomalous Hall
   effect, the research on topology as an organizing principle of quantum
   matter is greatly enriched from the interplay with magnetism. In this
   vein, we present a combined electrical and thermoelectrical transport
   study on the magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd2As2. Unconventional
   contribution to the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects were
   observed both above and below the magnetic transition temperature of
   EuCd2As2, indicating the existence of significant Berry curvature.
   EuCd2As2 represents a rare case in which this unconventional transverse
   transport emerges both above and below the magnetic transition
   temperature in the same material. The transport properties evolve with
   temperature and field in the antiferromagnetic phase in a different
   manner than in the paramagnetic phase, suggesting different mechanisms
   to their origin. Our results indicate EuCd2As2 is a fertile playground
   for investigating the interplay between magnetism and topology, and
   potentially a plethora of topologically nontrivial phases rooted in this
   interplay.},

Title = {Radial Spin Texture of the Weyl Fermions in Chiral Tellurium},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},

Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {Trigonal tellurium, a small-gap semiconductor with pronounced
   magneto-electric and magneto-optical responses, is among the simplest
   realizations of a chiral crystal. We have studied by spin- and
   angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy its unconventional electronic
   structure and unique spin texture. We identify Kramers-Weyl, composite,
   and accordionlike Weyl fermions, so far only predicted by theory, and
   show that the spin polarization is parallel to the wave vector along the
   lines in k space connecting high-symmetry points. Our results clarify
   the symmetries that enforce such spin texture in a chiral crystal, thus
   bringing new insight in the formation of a spin vectorial field more
   complex than the previously proposed hedgehog configuration. Our
   findings thus pave the way to a classification scheme for these exotic
   spin textures and their search in chiral crystals.},

Title = {Many-Body Resonance in a Correlated Topological Kagome Antiferromagnet},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {We use scanning tunneling microscopy to elucidate the atomically
   resolved electronic structure in the strongly correlated kagome Weyl
   antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. In stark contrast to its broad single-particle
   electronic structure, we observe a pronounced resonance with a Fano line
   shape at the Fermi level resembling the many-body Kondo resonance. We
   find that this resonance does not arise from the step edges or atomic
   impurities but the intrinsic kagome lattice. Moreover, the resonance is
   robust against the perturbation of a vector magnetic field, but broadens
   substantially with increasing temperature, signaling strongly
   interacting physics. We show that this resonance can be understood as
   the result of geometrical frustration and strong correlation based on
   the kagome lattice Hubbard model. Our results point to the emergent
   many-body resonance behavior in a topological kagome magnet.},

Title = {Wannier90 as a community code: new features and applications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {16},
Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {Wannier90 is an open-source computer program for calculating
   maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch
   states. It is interfaced to many widely used electronic-structure codes
   thanks to its independence from the basis sets representing these Bloch
   states. In the past few years the development of Wannier90 has
   transitioned to a community-driven model; this has resulted in a number
   of new developments that have been recently released in Wannier90 v3.0.
   In this article we describe these new functionalities, that include the
   implementation of new features for wannierisation and disentanglement
   (symmetry-adapted Wannier functions, selectively-localised Wannier
   functions, selected columns of the density matrix) and the ability to
   calculate new properties (shift currents and Berry-curvature dipole, and
   a new interface to many-body perturbation theory); performance
   improvements, including parallelisation of the core code; enhancements
   in functionality (support for spinor-valued Wannier functions, more
   accurate methods to interpolate quantities in the Brillouin zone);
   improved usability (improved plotting routines, integration with
   high-throughput automation frameworks), as well as the implementation of
   modern software engineering practices (unit testing, continuous
   integration, and automatic source-code documentation). These new
   features, capabilities, and code development model aim to further
   sustain and expand the community uptake and range of applicability, that
   nowadays spans complex and accurate dielectric, electronic, magnetic,
   optical, topological and transport properties of materials.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},

Volume = {101},

Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {We extend the scope of Kitaev spin liquids to non-Archimedean lattices.
   For the pentaheptite lattice, which results from the proliferation of
   Stone-Wales defects on the honeycomb lattice, we find an exactly
   solvable non-Abelian chiral spin liquid with spontaneous time-reversal
   symmetry breaking due to lattice loops of odd length. Our findings call
   for potential extensions of exact results for Kitaev models which are
   based on reflection positivity, which is not fulfilled by the
   pentaheptite lattice. We further elaborate on potential realizations of
   our chiral spin-liquid proposal in strained alpha-RuCl3.},

Title = {Tunable anomalous Hall conductivity through volume-wise magnetic
   competition in a topological kagome magnet},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {Magnetic topological phases of quantum matter are an emerging frontier
   in physics and material science. Along these lines, several kagome
   magnets have appeared as the most promising platforms. Here, we explore
   magnetic correlations in the kagome magnet Co3Sn2S2. Using muon
   spin-rotation, we present evidence for competing magnetic orders in the
   kagome lattice of this compound. Our results show that while the sample
   exhibits an out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground state, an in-plane
   antiferromagnetic state appears at temperatures above 90 K, eventually
   attaining a volume fraction of 80\% around 170 K, before reaching a
   non-magnetic state. Strikingly, the reduction of the anomalous Hall
   conductivity (AHC) above 90 K linearly follows the disappearance of the
   volume fraction of the ferromagnetic state. We further show that the
   competition of these magnetic phases is tunable through applying either
   an external magnetic field or hydrostatic pressure. Our results taken
   together suggest the thermal and quantum tuning of Berry curvature
   induced AHC via external tuning of magnetic order.},

Title = {Magnetism and anomalous transport in the Weyl semimetal PrAlGe: possible
   route to axial gauge fields},
Journal = {NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},

Month = {JAN 17},
Abstract = {In magnetic Weyl semimetals, where magnetism breaks time-reversal
   symmetry, large magnetically sensitive anomalous transport responses are
   anticipated that could be useful for topological spintronics. The
   identification of new magnetic Weyl semimetals is therefore in high
   demand, particularly since in these systems Weyl node configurations may
   be easily modified using magnetic fields. Here we explore experimentally
   the magnetic semimetal PrAlGe, and unveil a direct correspondence
   between easy-axis Pr ferromagnetism and anomalous Hall and Nernst
   effects. With sizes of both the anomalous Hall conductivity and Nernst
   effect in good quantitative agreement with first principles
   calculations, we identify PrAlGe as a system where magnetic fields can
   connect directly to Weyl nodes via the Pr magnetisation. Furthermore, we
   find the predominantly easy-axis ferromagnetic ground state co-exists
   with a low density of nanoscale textured magnetic domain walls. We
   describe how such nanoscale magnetic textures could serve as a local
   platform for tunable axial gauge fields of Weyl fermions.},

Title = {Fractional corner charges in spin-orbit coupled crystals},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {We study two-dimensional spinful insulating phases of matter that are
   protected by time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. To characterize
   these phases, we employ the concept of corner charge fractionalization:
   corners can carry charges that are fractions of even multiples of the
   electric charge. The charges are quantized and topologically stable as
   long as all symmetries are preserved. We classify the different corner
   charge configurations for all point groups, and match them with the
   corresponding bulk topology. For this we employ symmetry indicators and
   (nested) Wilson loop invariants. We provide formulas that allow for a
   convenient calculation of the corner charge from Bloch wave functions
   and illustrate our results using the example of arsenic and antimony
   monolayers. Depending on the degree of structural buckling, these
   materials can exhibit two distinct obstructed atomic limits. We present
   density functional theory calculations for open flakes to support our
   findings.},

Title = {Nodeless superconductivity and its evolution with pressure in the
   layered dirac semimetal 2M-WS<sub>2</sub>},
Journal = {NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Recently, the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) system 2M-WS2 has
   been identified as a Dirac semimetal exhibiting both superconductivity
   with the highest T-c similar to 8.5 K among all the TMD materials and
   topological surface states. Here we report on muon spin rotation (mu SR)
   and density functional theory studies of microscopic SC properties and
   the electronic structure in 2M-WS2 at ambient and under hydrostatic
   pressures (rho(max) = 1.9 GPa). The SC order parameter in 2M-WS2 is
   determined to have single-gap s-wave symmetry. We further show a strong
   negative pressure effect on T-c and on the SC gap Delta. This may be
   partly caused by the pressure induced reduction of the size of the
   electron pocket around the Gamma-point. We also find that the superfluid
   density ns is weakly affected by pressure. The absence of a strong
   pressure effect on n(s) and the absence of a correlation between n(s)
   and T-c in 2M-WS2, in contrast to the other SC TMDs T-d-MoTe2 and
   2H-NbSe2, is explained in terms of its location in the optimal (ambient
   pressure) and above the optimal (under pressure) superconducting regions
   of the phase diagram and its large distance to the other possible
   competing or cooperating orders.},

Title = {Band structure of overdoped cuprate superconductors: Density functional

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {99},
Number = {22},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {A comprehensive angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of the
   band structure in singlelayer cuprates is presented with the aim of
   uncovering universal trends across different materials. Five different
   hole-and electron-overdoped cuprate superconductors
   (La1.59Eu0.2Sr0.21CuO4, La1.77Sr0.23CuO4, Bi1.74Pb0.38Sr1.88CuO6+delta,
   Tl2Ba2CuO6+delta, and Pr1.15La0.7Ce0.15CuO4) have been studied with
   special focus on the bands with a predominately d-orbital character.
   Using a light polarization analysis, the e(g) and t(2g) bands are
   identified across these materials. A clear correlation between the
   d(3z2-r2) band energy and the apical oxygen distance d(A) is
   demonstrated. Moreover, the compound dependence of the d(x2-y2) band
   bottom and the t(2g) band top is revealed. A direct comparison to
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing hybrid
   exchange-correlation functionals demonstrates excellent agreement. We
   thus conclude that the DFT methodology can be used to describe the
   global band structure of overdoped single-layer cuprates on both the
   hole-and electron-doped side.},

Abstract = {Electronic systems with flat bands are predicted to be a fertile ground
   for hosting emergent phenomena including unconventional magnetism and
   superconductivity(1-15), but materials that manifest this feature are
   rare. Here, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to elucidate the
   atomically resolved electronic states and their magnetic response in the
   kagome magnet Co3Sn2S2 (refs.(16-20)). We observe a pronounced peak at
   the Fermi level, which we identify as arising from the kinetically
   frustrated kagome flat band. On increasing the magnetic field up to +/-
   8 T, this state exhibits an anomalous magnetizationpolarized many-body
   Zeeman shift, dominated by an orbital moment that is opposite to the
   field direction. Such negative magnetism is induced by
   spin-orbit-coupling quantum phase effects(21-25) tied to non-trivial
   flat band systems. We image the flat band peak, resolve the associated
   negative magnetism and provide its connection to the Berry curvature
   field, showing that Co3Sn2S2 is a rare example of a kagome magnet where
   the low-energy physics can be dominated by the spin-orbit-coupled flat
   band.},

Title = {Ab <i>initio</i> calculation of the shift photocurrent by Wannier
   interpolation},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {97},
Number = {24},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {We describe and implement a first-principles algorithm based on
   maximally localized Wannier functions for calculating the shift-current
   response of piezoelectric crystals in the independent-particle
   approximation. The proposed algorithm presents several advantages over
   existing ones, including full gauge invariance, low computational cost,
   and a correct treatment of the optical matrix elements with nonlocal
   pseudopotentials. Band-truncation errors are avoided by a careful
   formulation of k . p perturbation theory within the subspace of
   wannierized bands. The needed ingredients are the matrix elements of the
   Hamiltonian and of the position operator in the Wannier basis, which are
   readily available at the end of the wannierization step. If the
   off-diagonal matrix elements of the position operator are discarded, our
   expressions reduce to the ones that have been used in recent
   tight-binding calculations of the shift current. We find that this
   ``diagonal{''} approximation can introduce sizable errors, highlighting
   the importance of carefully embedding the tight-binding model in real
   space for an accurate description of the charge transfer that gives rise
   to the shift current.},

Title = {Gyrotropic effects in trigonal tellurium studied from first principles},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {97},
Number = {3},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {We present a combined ab initio study of several gyrotropic effects in
   p-doped trigonal tellurium (effects that reverse direction with the
   handedness of the spiral chains in the atomic structure). The key
   ingredients in our study are the k-space Berry curvature and intrinsic
   orbital magnetic moment imparted on the Bloch states by the chirality of
   the crystal structure. We show that the observed sign reversal with
   temperature of the circular photogalvanic effect can be explained by the
   presence of Weyl points near the bottom of the conduction band acting as
   sources and sinks of Berry curvature. The passage of a current along the
   trigonal axis induces a rather small parallel magnetization, which can
   nevertheless be detected by optical means (Faraday rotation of
   transmitted light) due to the high transparency of the sample. In
   agreement with experiment, we find that when infrared light propagates
   antiparallel to the current at low doping the current-induced optical
   rotation enhances the natural optical rotation. According to our
   calculations the plane of polarization rotates in the opposite sense to
   the bonded atoms in the spiral chains, in agreement with a recent
   experiment that contradicts earlier reports.},

Title = {Composite Weyl nodes stabilized by screw symmetry with and without
   time-reversal invariance},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {96},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {We classify the band degeneracies in three-dimensional crystals with
   screw symmetry n(m) and broken P{*}T symmetry, where P stands for
   spatial inversion and T for time reversal. The generic degeneracies
   along symmetry lines are Weyl nodes: chiral contact points between pairs
   of bands. They can be single nodes with a chiral charge of magnitude
   |chi| = 1 or composite nodes with |chi| = 2 or 3, and the possible chi
   values only depend on the order n of the axis, not on the pitch m/n of
   the screw. Double Weyl nodes require n = 4 or 6, and triple nodes
   require n = 6. In all cases, the bands split linearly along the axis,
   and for composite nodes the splitting is quadratic on the orthogonal
   plane. This is true for triple as well as double nodes, due to the
   presence in the effective two-band Hamiltonian of a nonchiral quadratic
   term that masks the chiral cubic dispersion. If T symmetry is present
   and P is broken, there may exist on some symmetry lines Weyl nodes
   pinned to T-invariant momenta, which in some cases are unavoidable. In
   the absence of other symmetries, their classification depends on n, m,
   and the type of T symmetry. With spinless T such T-invariant Weyl nodes
   are always double nodes, while with spinful T they can be single or
   triple nodes. T-invariant triples nodes can occur not only on sixfold
   axes but also on threefold ones, and their in-plane band splitting is
   cubic, not quadratic as in the case of generic triple nodes. These rules
   are illustrated by means of first-principles calculations for hcp
   cobalt, a T-broken, P-invariant crystal with 63 symmetry, and for
   trigonal tellurium and hexagonal NbSi2, which are T-invariant, P-broken
   crystals with threefold and sixfold screw symmetry, respectively.},

   states},

Abstract = {We present a theoretical study of lifetimes of interface states (IS)
   onmetal-organic interfaces PTCDA/Ag(111), NTCDA/Ag(111), PFP/Ag(111),
   and PTCDA/Ag(100), describing and explaining the recent experimental
   data. By means of unfolding the band structure of one of the interfaces
   under study onto the Ag(111) Brillouin zone we demonstrate that the
   Brillouin zone folding upon organic monolayer deposition plays a minor
   role in the phase space for electron decay, and hence weakly affects the
   resulting lifetimes. The presence of the unoccupied molecular states
   below the IS gives a small contribution to the IS decay rate, which is
   mostly determined by the change of the phase space of bulk states upon
   the energy shift of the IS. The calculated lifetimes follow the
   experimentally observed trends. In particular, we explain the trend of
   the unusual increase of the IS lifetimes with rising temperature.},

Title = {Variation of the character of spin-orbit interaction by Pt intercalation
   underneath graphene on Ir(111)},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {92},
Number = {16},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The modification of the graphene spin structure is of interest for novel
   possibilities of application of graphene in spintronics. The most
   exciting of them demand not only high value of spin-orbit splitting of
   the graphene states, but non-Rashba behavior of the splitting and
   spatial modulation of the spin-orbit interaction. In this work we study
   the spin and electronic structure of graphene on Ir(111) with
   intercalated Pt monolayer. Pt interlayer does not change the 9.3 x 9.3
   superlattice of graphene, while the spin structure of the Dirac cone
   becomes modified. It is shown that the Rashba splitting of the pi state
   is reduced, while hybridization of the graphene and substrate states
   leads to a spin-dependent avoided-crossing effect near the Fermi level.
   Such a variation of spin-orbit interaction combined with the
   superlattice effects can induce a topological phase in graphene.},

Title = {New generation of two-dimensional spintronic systems realized by
   coupling of Rashba and Dirac fermions},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Intriguing phenomena and novel physics predicted for two-dimensional
   (2D) systems formed by electrons in Dirac or Rashba states motivate an
   active search for new materials or combinations of the already revealed
   ones. Being very promising ingredients in themselves, interplaying Dirac
   and Rashba systems can provide a base for next generation of spintronics
   devices, to a considerable extent, by mixing their striking properties
   or by improving technically significant characteristics of each other.
   Here, we demonstrate that in BiTeI@PbSb2Te4 composed of a BiTeI trilayer
   on top of the topological insulator (TI) PbSb2Te4 weakly- and
   strongly-coupled Dirac-Rashba hybrid systems are realized. The coupling
   strength depends on both interface hexagonal stacking and
   trilayer-stacking order. The weakly-coupled system can serve as a
   prototype to examine, e.g., plasmonic excitations, frictional drag,
   spin-polarized transport, and charge-spin separation effect in
   multilayer helical metals. In the strongly-coupled regime, within
   similar to 100 meV energy interval of the bulk TI projected bandgap a
   helical state substituting for the TI surface state appears. This new
   state is characterized by a larger momentum, similar velocity, and
   strong localization within BiTeI. We anticipate that our findings pave
   the way for designing a new type of spintronics devices based on
   Rashba-Dirac coupled systems.},

   as the sum of the partial spectral weights W-m (K) over right
   arrow(mu)((k) over right arrow) calculated for each component mu =

   which unfolds the primitive cell expectation values phi(pc)((k) over

Title = {Nontrivial spin structure of graphene on Pt(111) at the Fermi level due

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {90},

Abstract = {The electronic and spin structure of a graphene monolayer synthesized on
   Pt(111) has been investigated experimentally by angle- and spin-resolved
   photoemission with different polarizations of incident synchrotron
   radiation and using density functional theory calculations. It is shown
   that despite the observed total quasifreestanding character of the
   dispersion of the graphene pi state remarkable local distortions and
   breaks in the dispersions take place due to hybridization between the
   graphene pi and Pt d states. Corresponding spin-dependent
   avoided-crossing effects lead to significant modification of the spin
   structure and cause an enhanced induced spin-orbit splitting of the
   graphene pi states near the Fermi level in the region of the (K)over-bar
   point of the graphene Brillouin zone (BZ) with a magnitude of 80-200 meV
   depending on the direction in the BZ. Using p, s, and elliptical
   polarizations of the synchrotron radiation, the contributions of the
   graphene pi and Pt d states were separated and their intersection at the
   Fermi level, which is important for effective spin injection between
   these states, was shown. Moreover, analysis of the data allows us to
   conclude that in the region of the Dirac point the spin structure of the
   system cannot be described by a Rashba splitting, and even a spin-orbit
   gap between lower and upper Dirac cones is observed.},

Title = {Many-body interactions and Rashba splitting of the surface state on

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Number = {8},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
   elucidate the Rashba splitting of Delta k(F) = 0.003 angstrom(-1) near
   the Fermi level (E-F) in the Shockley surface state of Cu(110) at the
   (Y) over bar point of the surface Brillouin zone. The observed
   energy-band dispersion exhibits a kink structure at similar to-20 meV,
   which is a clear indication of band renormalization caused by an
   electron-phonon interaction. The electron-phonon coupling parameter is
   found to be lambda(ep) = 0.17 +/- 0.02 based on the experimentally
   obtained real part of the self-energy. First-principle calculations
   yield lambda(ep) = 0.160 and Delta k(F) = 0.004 angstrom(-1) at E-F,
   which are fully consistent with the experimental results. In addition,
   the contributions of the electron-electron and electron-phonon
   interactions to the linewidth of the surface state at the Y point are
   experimentally determined to be Gamma(ee) similar to 9 meV and Gamma(ep)
   similar to 7 meV, respectively. We demonstrate that the Rashba splitting
   must be resolved by photoemission line-shape analysis for an accurate
   determination of the electron self-energy and coupling parameters.},

Abstract = {The energies and lifetimes of the image potential resonances at the (Y)
   over bar point on the Cu(110), Ag(110), and Au(110) surfaces are
   studied, and the energies of the image potential states on the Pd(110)
   surface are analyzed. It is shown that every quantum number n
   corresponds to a pair of image potential states (resonances) n(+) and
   n(-) at the (Y) over bar point. The average energy of a pair of
   eigenstates (resonances) at n >= 2 is well described by the formula (E)
   over bar (n) = (En+ + En-) = E-0 - (0.85 eV)/(n + delta)(2), where delta
   is the quantum defect, E-0 = (1/2m(e))((h) over bar pi/a)(2), and a is
   the lattice parameter. The splitting energy of a pair of eigenstates
   (resonances) obeys the law Delta E-n = En+ - En- proportional to n(-3).
   The lifetimes t(n +/-) of image potential resonances are proportional to
   n(3).},

Abstract = {The ability to engineer an electronic band structure of topological
   insulators would allow the production of topological materials with
   tailor-made properties. Using ab initio calculations, we show a
   promising way to control the conducting surface state in topological
   insulator based heterostructures representing an insulator ultrathin
   films on the topological insulator substrates. Because of a specific
   relation between work functions and band gaps of the topological
   insulator substrate and the insulator ultrathin film overlayer, a
   sizable shift of the Dirac point occurs resulting in a significant
   increase in the number of the topological surface state charge carriers
   as compared to that of the substrate itself. Such an effect can also be
   realized by applying the external electric field that allows a gradual
   tuning of the topological surface state. A simultaneous use of both
   approaches makes it possible to obtain a topological insulator based
   heterostructure with a highly tunable topological surface state.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},

Abstract = {We performed a scanning tunneling spectroscopy investigation of the
   electronic properties of the topological insulator Bi2Te3 in the energy
   range between -200 and +700 meV with respect to the Fermi level. For
   unoccupied states, tunneling into topological surface states dominates.
   Analysis of Fourier-transformed (FT) dI/dU maps allowed us to obtain
   their energy dispersion relation and to visualize the breakdown of the
   linear dispersion relation typical of massless particles. For occupied
   states, no signature of scattering events involving surface states can
   be detected. FT dI/dU maps reveal in this case two scattering vectors
   pointing along the (Gamma M) over bar and (Gamma K) over bar directions.
   Both are identified with scattering events within bulk states.
   Interestingly, vectors pointing along (Gamma K) over bar which
   correspond to bulk backscattering events have a length longer than the
   minimum distance necessary to match opposite pockets on a constant
   energy cut. Comparison with calculated spin-resolved constant-energy
   cuts shows that this is a direct consequence of the chiral spin texture
   present in bulk states when their energy and momentum are close to the
   resonances of the spin-polarized topological surface states.},

Title = {Green's function approach to the lifetimes of image potential resonances
   at metal surfaces},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},

Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {We present a theoretical study of the image potential resonances (IPRs)
   at metal surfaces. We develop the Green's functions approach allowing us
   to calculate binding energies E-n and lifetimes tau(n) of IPRs with high
   quantum numbers n (up to 10 in this work). A systematic study is
   performed at the (Gamma) over bar point for the close-packed metal
   surfaces: Cu(111), Ag(111), Au(111), Al(001), Al(111), Be(0001),
   Mg(0001), Na(110), Li(110), and also at the (Y) over bar point on
   Cu(110). The calculated lifetimes of IPRs on close-packed surfaces
   demonstrate the scaling law tau(n) proportional to n(3). Our results are
   in agreement with available experimental data. We show that at the (Y)
   over bar point on Cu(110) each quantum number n corresponds to a pair of
   IPRs n(+) and n(-), where the energy difference En+ - En- is
   proportional to n(-3). The lifetimes tau(n+) and tau(n-) differ
   significantly, however, they both obey the scaling law tau(n +/-)
   proportional to n(3). Since the electrons trapped in the long-lived IPRs
   are strongly localized on the vacuum side, we argue that the inelastic
   electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering have a small
   contribution to the decay rate of these IPRs. The latter is dominated by
   the resonant electron transfer into the bulk.},

   Ag surfaces},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {85},
Number = {20},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {The dependence of the inelastic lifetime of electrons in the first n = 1
   image-potential state of clean and rare-gas covered Ag(111), Cu(111),
   and Cu(100) surfaces on their momentum parallel to the surface has been
   studied experimentally by means of time-and angle-resolved two-photon
   photoemission spectroscopy (2PPE) and theoretically by calculations
   based on the many-body theory within the self-energy formalism. Similar
   to the previously studied clean Cu(100) surface, the theoretical results
   are in excellent agreement with the experiment findings for Cu(111). For
   Ag(111), the theory overestimates the decay rate and its momentum
   dependence, which is attributed to the neglect of surface plasmon
   excitations. With increasing parallel momentum, the n = 1 state shifts
   out of the projected bulk band gap on both surfaces and turns into an
   image-potential resonance. This opens an additional decay channel by
   resonant electron transfer into the bulk, which is theoretically treated
   by the application of the wave packet propagation approach. The expected
   stronger increase of the decay rate upon crossing the edge of the band
   gap, however, is not observed in the experiment. The decoupling of the
   image-potential states from the metal surface upon adsorption of
   rare-gas layers results in a decrease of the decay rate as well as of
   its momentum dependence by a similar factor, which can be successfully
   explained by the change of interband and intraband contributions to the
   total decay rate.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Abstract = {A topological insulator is a state of quantum matter that, while being
   an insulator in the bulk, hosts topologically protected electronic
   states at the surface. These states open the opportunity to realize a
   number of new applications in spintronics and quantum computing. To take
   advantage of their peculiar properties, topological insulators should be
   tuned in such a way that ideal and isolated Dirac cones are located
   within the topological transport regime without any scattering channels.

Abstract = {This paper reports on the results of calculations of the contributions
   from the electron-phonon interaction to the line width of the surface
   electronic states on Pd(111). The calculations have been performed both
   using an ab initio method based on the electron density functional
   theory and the linear response method in the pseudopotential
   representation with a mixed basis set and using a model that includes
   the description of the electronic structure of the surface by a
   one-dimensional model potential. The phonon contribution to the width of
   the lines has been analyzed for all the surface states under
   consideration. It has been demonstrated that the line width due to the
   electron-phonon interaction exhibits a weak anisotropy and that the
   character of changes in the line width with variations in the energy and
   the wave vector of the electron depends first of all on the particular
   surface energy band.},

Abstract = {The dependence of the intrinsic line width I{''} of electron and hole
   states due to inelastic scattering on the wave vector k (ayen) in the
   occupied surface state and the first image potential state on the
   Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces has been calculated using the GW
   approximation, which simulates the self-energy of the quasiparticles by
   the product of the Greens's function and the dynamically screened
   Coulomb potential. Different contributions to the relaxation of electron
   and hole excitations have been analyzed. It has been demonstrated that,
   for both surfaces, the main channel of relaxation of holes in the
   occupied surface states is intraband scattering and that, for electrons
   in the image potential states, the interband transitions play a decisive
   role. A sharp decrease in the intrinsic line width of the hole state
   with an increase in k (ayen) is caused by a decrease in the number of
   final states, whereas an increase in I{''} of the image potential state
   is predominantly determined by an increase of its overlap with bulk
   states.},

Abstract = {A detailed theoretical study of electron-phonon interaction in occupied

   Pd(110) is carried out. We show that in the unoccupied surface state on
   Cu(110) and Ag(110) the e-ph coupling parameter lambda is about three
   times smaller than that in the occupied surface state due to distinct
   phonon modes that contribute to e-ph scattering. The difference in
   mechanisms of phonon-mediated scattering for excited holes and electrons
   results from distinct spatial localization of occupied and unoccupied
   states. In spite of both (Y) over bar surface states on Pd(110) are
   unoccupied they have spatial distribution similar to that on other
   considered noble metal surfaces that leads to different phonon-mediated
   scattering in these states too.},

Abstract = {We present the results of a detailed theoretical study of the
   electron-phonon scattering of electron and hole excitations in the
   unoccupied and occupied surface states on an Ag(110) surface. We show
   that the electron-phonon coupling parameter lambda in the unoccupied
   surface state is approximately three times smaller than that in the
   occupied one, because the scattering of these states is determined by
   different phonon modes. The difference in the phonon-induced decay
   mechanisms of electron and hole excitations is determined by different
   spatial localizations of the unoccupied and occupied surface states at
   the (Y) over bar point of the two-dimensional Brillouin zone.},

Abstract = {A method has been proposed for constructing the two-dimensional
   pseudopotential describing the electronic structure of the Cu(110)
   surface. This method can also be applied to construct the corresponding
   pseudopotentials for the (110) surface of a number of other
   face-centered cubic metals, such as Ag, Au, Al, Pd, and Pt. The
   electronic structure obtained can be used for fast calculations of
   single-particle and collective electron excitations both on the pure
   Cu(110) surface and on the surface covered with adatoms or ultrathin
   films of other metals.},
